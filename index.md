## Background

Howdy, my name is Devarsh Raval and welcome to my project portfolio. I am a Master's student pursuing Industrial Engineering with a data science specialization. In the past year I have been learning data science through personal projects using datasets that pique my interest such as financial, demographics and consumer data.
