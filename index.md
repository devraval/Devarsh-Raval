## Background

Howdy, my name is Devarsh Raval and welcome to my project portfolio. I am a Master's student pursuing Industrial Engineering with a data science specialization. In the past year I have been learning data science through personal projects using datasets that pique my interest such as financial, demographics and consumer data. 


# Projects

## [Game Of Thrones Final Season Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/devraval/GOT_S08_sentiments) 
The objective is to predict how a tweet would rate the tv series on scale of 10 compared to reviews on IMDb. For this, a custom model is to be built trained on the IMDb reviews and a pre-trained model vader sentiment also is to be used. It is an ongoing project. 

## [IPL data analysis in SQL](https://github.com/devraval/ipl-data-analysis)
The analysis was done using Postgresql database management system.
Key insights sought during analysis such as 
1)Team with most wins over entire time frame and per season
2)Common attributes of top run scorers such as age, batting style, experience :
(a) Top run scorers are 5 years older on average. (b) 40 % more likely to be left handed batsman than on average. (c) Has played 20-25 more matches than the average player.
3)Most valuable batsmen based on correlation of their runs and team victory.
